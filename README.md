[See the interactive visualization here](http://marioariasga.github.io/lod-cloud)

![](/screenshots/screenshot.png)

The above diagram represents the famous [Linked Open Data Cloud](http://lod-cloud.net) as an interactive [chord diagram](https://github.com/mbostock/d3/wiki/Chord-Layout) depicting the relationships among datasets using [D3.js](http://d3js.org). The data is extracted from the [datahub.io](http://datahub.io) dataset repository, [converted to RDF](https://github.com/lod-cloud/datahub2void), and processed using the [RDF/HDT](http://www.rdfhdt.org) tools. Special thanks to [Richard Cyganiak](http://richard.cyganiak.de/) and [Anja Jentzsch](http://anjeve.de/) for creating the original LOD Cloud diagram, and specially Richard for his feedback.
